    <h3>Information about Sports</h3>
    <div>Any definition of "sport" can be contentious. In practical terms ‘sport’ has been operationally defined by its
        social interpretation as well as its strong association with physical exertion and performance measures.

        What we perceive as "sport" in one instance may not be in another; sport takes on many forms and is constantly
        changing based upon societal norms, trends, and new directions. Equally important, if a physical activity is
        ‘not sport’, what is it? And what relationship does it have to sport?</div>

    <pre>Defining sport
            Definitions of sport may also be accompanied by definitions for one or more similar, closely related, activities that are ‘not sport’.

            Sport
            A human activity involving physical exertion and skill as the primary focus of the activity, with elements of competition or social participation where rules and patterns of behaviour governing the activity exist formally through organisations and is generally recognised as a sport.

            Organised sport
            The degree of organisational structure that surrounds and influences the sport helps to distinguish whether an activity is classified as ‘organised sport’.

            Sport participation
            Sport participation is not easily defined and will often depend on how it is perceived by the observer. As a guide, a ‘sport participant’ is a person who takes part in a sporting activity, whether in a formal or informal capacity.
