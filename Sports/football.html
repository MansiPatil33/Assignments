    <h2>Football</h2>
    <p>football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of
        their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the
        goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The
        team that scores more goals wins.</p>

    <div><b>History</b></div>
    <p>The early years
        Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games
        had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization
        and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined
        with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to
        undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game
        between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school
        had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it
        difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early
        as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose
        students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by
        Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan
        London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the
        ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by
        1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA.
